You've heard the news - deep learning is taking over. Google uses it to organize your photos, the post office uses it to read zip codes, and self-driving cars use it to help navigate. Now, understand exactly how deep learning works and how it can be applied to image recognition. This workshop is for people who want to open the black-box of deep learning and learn how to build their own state-of-the-art image recognition deep nets. This course is currently in beta testing. Please, [contact us](mailto:schoolofdatasci@gmail.com) for more details and to get on the wait-list. 

Highlights:

* Learn the fundamentals of image neural networks such as fully connected layers, convolutional layers, activation functions, and pooling.
* Use Python and Keras to train your own networks on GPUs using [Floyd Hub](https://www.floydhub.com/).
* Understand how to use transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained network.
* Write your own code to implement a state-of-the-art network to teach a simulated car to drive itself around a track.
