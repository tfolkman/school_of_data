Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses data to teach machines without having to hard code specific rules. For example, machine learning could use past data on housing prices and characteristics of houses to learn to predict future housing prices. It does so without requiring the programmer to explicitly tell it rules like, "for each bedroom add $100." Machine learning is now used in many products that you interact with such as Facebook, Google, and Netflix. This workshop will teach you how to use best practices when developing machine learning models as well as common pitfalls to avoid. It will focus on the theory and building of linear models for regression and classification problems and how to interpret these models. Please, [contact us](mailto:schoolofdatasci@gmail.com) for more details and to get on the wait-list. 

Highlights:

* Gain experience using scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy to go from raw data to machine learning algorithm.
* Understand the theory behind gradient descent and implement your own gradient descent algorithm for logistic regression.
* Learn best practices for building and evaluating a machine learning model.
* Implement and interpret linear and logistic regression.
