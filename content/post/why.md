Let's be honest, a 1 day workshop will not transform you into a data scientist, but it is a step towards understanding how to use data to drive value. We are big believers in continuous learning and see our workshops as stepping stones to you feeling empowered to make data driven decisions. 

But what is the big deal with data anyways? Well, for one, [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2012/10/big-data-the-management-revolution) found, "companies in the top third of their industry in the use of data-driven decision making were, on average, 5% more productive and 6% more profitable than their competitors."

This has not gone unnoticed and companies are scrambling to empower all their employees to be data savvy. For example, Airbnb has developed an [internal data university](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/24/airbnb-is-running-its-own-internal-university-to-teach-data-science/) to increase data literacy across the entire company.

We see a bright future for those who understand data. As [Mark Cuban](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/mark-cuban-on-why-you-need-to-study-artificial-intelligence-or-youll-be-a-dinosaur-in-3-years-db3447bea1b4) said, "Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, machine learning — whatever you’re doing if you don’t understand it — learn it. Because otherwise you’re going to be a dinosaur within 3 years." Let us help you not become a dinosaur.
